This dataset consists of electroencephalography (EEG) signals adquired with a 124 EEG ANT-Neuro device. There are 13 participants included, ten performed one session and three performed two sessions.
The task consisted of imagining and perceiving stimuli from three modalities; visual pictorial, visual orthographic (writing) or auditory. Each of the stimuli belonged to one of three categories: guitar, flower and penguin. These categories were selected based on being semantically dissimilar to one another, and because there were all of 2 syllables. 

The dataset provided consists of the raw EEG data, a pre-processed version, and an epoched version. 


The BCI protocol consisted of two conditions, namely the kinesthetic imagination of grasping movement (MI) of the dominant hand and rest/idle condition.Five protocol runs were asked to be performed by the user. The first run, called RUN0, involved real grasping movement in order to better explain the protocol and to help the subject to focus on the sensation of making the movement. The rest of the runs (RUN1-RUN4) were equal, consisting of MI vs.Rest conditions. The EMG signals of the dominant hand was adquired for protocol control. During acquisition, the EEG signals were filtered between 0.5 and 45 Hz with a 3rd order Butterworth bandpass-filter.
