### Dataset

This dataset consists of electroencephalography (EEG) signals adquired with a 124 EEG ANT-Neuro device. There are 13 participants included, ten performed one session and three performed two sessions.
The task consisted of imagining and perceiving stimuli from three modalities; visual pictorial, visual orthographic (writing) or auditory. Each of the stimuli belonged to one of three categories: guitar, flower and penguin. These categories were selected based on being semantically dissimilar to one another, and because there were all of 2 syllables. 

The dataset provided consists of the raw EEG data, a pre-processed version, and an epoched version.
